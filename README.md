# Display Rotater
I made this program so I could easily switch my other monitor from Landscape to Vertical.

## Usage
*Program may require [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) to open.*

Open the file and right click the new monitor icon in the [system tray](https://www.google.com/search?q=system+tray).
